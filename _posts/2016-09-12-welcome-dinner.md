Welcome to Northeastern Women in Technology for fall semester 2016!

We started off the night with some delicous Thai food catered by Thaitation in Behrakis. The officers were thrilled with an unexpectedly large turnout.

Later, we had a trivia night. Questions ranged from the oldest building on Northeastern campus to who the first programmer was. Then two winning teams receive t-shirts as prizes.
