Welcome to another great year of NUWIT!

This year's welcome dinner was once again catered by Thaitation, and we were excited to see so many
new and returning members.

We were able to hear from some of CCIS's faculty and administration, followed by an inspiring
Q and A session with CCIS alumna Martha Hamlin.

We hope to see everyone again at our next meeting!
