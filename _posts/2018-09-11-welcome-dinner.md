Once again, NUWIT got to see lots of new faces at our yearly welcome dinner! With over 94 RSVPs and even more real attendees, there were lots of people enjoying Thai food and talking about tech. 

We started the meeting with an overview of our club. [Here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LK_0PHu2SQ0MEOAUO103Z4qjQ_75i7V0XwU-YdLpVC4/edit?usp=sharing) is the presentation, in case you missed it. 

We also enjoyed seeing a few NUWIT members demo some of their tech-related projects. Bahar Sheikhi presented her Software Development project, Spoiled Tomatillos, which is a social media and rating site for movies. Then Abigail Hodge and Web Chair Michelle Pine  presented their Hackbeanpot project, Emotiquote, which analyzes the emotions found on Wikiquote pages. These projects are crazy cool, and they're just the start of what women in tech can do!

We hope you enjoyed our welcome dinner this year, and we look forward to seeing you at our next meeting!
