NUWIT members once again got to experience a great tech talk last week with Datadog, one of the tech companies that partners with Northeastern for co-op! 

Datadog provides widely-used services that monitor and analyze the performance of software, applications, databases, and more. Datadog gave NUWIT a great demo of their company's product and talked a little about what it's like to be a woman in the tech industry! In case you missed it, [here's the link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J6sikhgD9_EIQz7C8QVJJ7tZNEwrfS74/view?usp=sharing) to their awesome presentation.

Want more info about Datadog? Contact our super cool presenter, Natalie Altman at [natalie@datadoghq.com](mailto:natalie@datadoghq.com) 
Datadog's tech is also available from the student developer pack if you want to [try it out](education.github.com/pack) yourself: 

Thanks for being part of NUWIT, and we look forward to seeing your at our next meeting! :)
