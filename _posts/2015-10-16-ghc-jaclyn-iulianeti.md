Since this was my first time attending the Grace Hopper Celebration, I had no idea what to expect, especially when it came to the career fair. During the evening of the first day, thousands of us lined up outside of the doors waiting for the career fair to start. When they let us in, it was a mess of students, companies, food and free t shirts- overwhelming to say the least. For the remaining two days, I spent most of my time in the career fair, networking and learning about companies and cool projects. This was definitely my favorite part of GHC, and I can't wait to go again next year!
