Talia and Colleen from HubSpot joined us last night to talk about imposter syndrome and gave some great advice
about how to overcome it. Imposter syndrome is marked by a collection of feelings of inadequacy, and this 
is especially common among women in tech. To anyone who might have these feelings, remember that your opinions
and your skills are valid, and you deserve to be doing what you are doing!

HubSpot will also have a FaceBook Live event on October 11, 2017 at 4pm about interviews-- be sure to check it out!
