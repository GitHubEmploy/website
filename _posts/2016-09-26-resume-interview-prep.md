Normal Monday meeting where we have people reviewing resumes and giving feedback. We will have set up technical interview questions.

Here are some resources:
- [12 Tricky Job Interview Questions](https://skillcrush.com/2015/10/15/answer-the-toughest-tech-interview-questions/)
- [Programming Interview Preparations Made Easy](https://www.interviewbit.com/)


### Technical Interview Tips:
- Repeat the question and write it down
- Write down test/examples for it first to be clear what you want to accomplish
- Communicate what you are thinking
- Don't be afraid to ask for help/a nudge in the right direction
- Don't worry about syntax
- Pseudocode
- Leave space between lines for edits
- Don't need to elegant, just needs to work: time for refinements once you have a working solution.


### Examples of questions:
- reverse a string (loop and recursion)
- is a string a palindrome
- print the fibonacci sequence
- factorialize a number (loop and recursion)
- remove a duplicate in array
- is a permutation
- two circles overlap
